# Modal Hover Improvements - Test Checklist

## Google Drive Modal (hover-with-lock) - Primary Test

### Basic Hover Behavior
- [ ] Hover over Google Drive link opens modal smoothly
- [ ] Parent card (WORKSPACE) stays locked showing its back
- [ ] Card remains locked while modal is open

### Mouse Movement Transitions
- [ ] Moving mouse from Google Drive bookmark to modal keeps card locked (no flip back)
- [ ] Modal stays open when hovering over it
- [ ] Smooth transition with no jarring animations

### Modal Closing Behavior
- [ ] Modal closes 300ms after mouse leaves modal area
- [ ] Card unlocks appropriately when modal closes
- [ ] If mouse is still on card when modal closes, card stays locked until mouse leaves
- [ ] If mouse has left card area, card unlocks immediately

### Alternative Close Methods
- [ ] ESC key closes modal and unlocks card properly
- [ ] Clicking overlay closes modal and unlocks card
- [ ] Opening a different modal closes current modal and unlocks previous card

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Rapidly moving mouse between bookmark and modal doesn't cause flickering
- [ ] Multiple quick hovers don't create duplicate modals
- [ ] Card returns to normal hover behavior after modal closes
- [ ] No lingering locked states after modal interactions

## GitHub Modal (click) - Alternative Interaction

### Click Behavior
- [ ] Clicking GitHub link opens modal
- [ ] Card doesn't lock (normal hover behavior maintained)
- [ ] Modal stays open until explicitly closed
- [ ] ESC key closes modal
- [ ] Overlay click closes modal

## Animation & Performance

### Visual Quality
- [ ] Modal fade-in animation is smooth
- [ ] Modal fade-out animation is smooth
- [ ] Card lock/unlock transitions are instant (no delay)
- [ ] No visual glitches or layout shifts

### Performance
- [ ] No lag when opening modals
- [ ] Mouse tracking is responsive
- [ ] No memory leaks with repeated modal opens/closes

## User Experience Flow

### Expected Flow (Google Drive)
1. [ ] User hovers over WORKSPACE card → card flips to show back
2. [ ] User hovers over Google Drive bookmark → modal opens, card stays showing back
3. [ ] User moves mouse into modal → card still showing back, smooth transition
4. [ ] User clicks a link in modal → opens in new tab, modal closes, card unlocks
5. [ ] OR user moves mouse away → 300ms delay, modal closes, card unlocks
6. [ ] Card returns to normal hover behavior

## Browser Compatibility
Test in:
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Edge
- [ ] Safari (if available)

## Final Verification
- [ ] All modals are functioning as intended
- [ ] No console errors during interactions
- [ ] User experience feels natural and intuitive
- [ ] Performance is smooth across all interactions

## Notes
- Google Sheets modal has been removed (lock-card only version wasn't ideal)
- GitHub modal uses click interaction as an alternative approach
- Google Drive uses the new hybrid hover-with-lock approach
